# Basic_CNN_Convolutional_Neural_Network

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CNN is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to upload images and get predictions.

## Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 images across 10 classes, such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more. The goal of this project is to train a CNN model that can classify these images effectively and allow users to test their own images through a simple interface.

## Features

- Load an image from your local machine.
- Predict the class of the uploaded image using the trained CNN model.
- Clear the interface to upload a new image.
- Display the prediction result in the GUI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PIL (Pillow)
- Tkinter (comes with standard Python installation)
